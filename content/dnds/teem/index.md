Teem started life in a cold war, his tribe driven far beneath the earth.
When his tribe was gifted a reincarnation of Tiamat - Dogmak, the languid - they lashed out with religious vigor to protect her.
Near the surface again, Teem built signs no longer tricking Goblin scouts, but instead helping pilgrims traveling to Dogmaks birth-site.
Deep below in a tunnel less traveled he finds a door with a crystal knob, touches it, and hears Dogmuk.
A bloodthirsty gnome is terrorizing their den.
Hearing what the kobolds would pay, a "Magic Fire Food" hunts it down, decapitating it.
Dogmuk speaks.
Teem must learn from the outsider and spread word of Dogmuks glory, quelling all dissenting voices.

Notes:

* Archfey is tricking Teem and his tribe with fake Tiamat (Dogmuk)
* Most odd occurrences with Teem or his tribe can be attributed to fey (gnome)
* Kurtulmak, Kobold God, hates tricksters (see Garl Glittergold)
